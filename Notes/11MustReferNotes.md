## Overview of ECMAScript and JavaScript

- **ECMAScript** is the scripting language that provides specifications for JavaScript.
- It defines the syntax and standards of JavaScript, making it helpful for new libraries, compilers, and beginners to get familiar with the syntax.
- In short, ECMAScript provides the set of rules that should be used while implementing JavaScript.
- The latest version is the **ES6 Syntax Version**.

 >**JavaScript DOM** and **Async** nature are beyond the scope of ECMAScript, which is crucial for Web Development but not defined by ES6.

### Key Compilers for JavaScript

- Two important compilers for JS are **V8** and **SpiderMonkey**.
- **Node.js** uses V8.

### Role of Node.js

- Node.js made the Backend possible via JS; V8 was embedded in JS and added some backend stuff, creating Node.js.
- 99% of Times we use Node.js for **HTTP Server** creation.
- Node.js has a competitor named **Bun**, written in Zig language and is very fast.
- However, we are focusing on Node.js here due to the larger community.


## HTTP Protocol

- Simplest way for your **Frontend To Interact With The Backend**.
- HTTP server helps Frontend interact with local Frontend with the remote Backend Server.
> When we send a request from Client side we have to specify **Protocol, Address, Route, Method and the Header**.
